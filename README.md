Various automation scripts for use in Cinema 4D

Notes for BO4 auto texture script:

1/ Texture Images must be exported in .png format from greyhound and reside in "_images" folder (this is greyhound default)
2/ "_images" folder must be named as such and reside in same directory as xmaterial text files (these hold material mapping info)
